It's finally Christmas Eve and the last door of the LEGP Advent Calendar is open. It's Darth Vader in a ugly sweater. Darth sweater's show the Death Star.

The sweater is red with white desgins. I used a couple shades of red, white, and cornsilk, all the red and white was too jarring.

I've done a few of these now and have a bit of a template. The main characte  gor s in the center of the sweat rin Character div. The Death Stare is onlt 3 divs.  
```HTML
       <div class="character">
         <div class="deathStar">       
            <div class="outer_dish"></div>
            <div class="trench"></div>
          </div>            
       </div>
```
